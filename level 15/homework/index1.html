    <h2>The grey parrot <p>(Psittacus erithacus), also known as the Congo grey parrot, African grey parrot or Congo African grey parrot, is an African parrot in the family Psittacidae. The Timneh parrot (Psittacus timneh) was previously treated as a subspecies of the grey parrot, but has since been elevated to a full species.</p>

        Taxonomy
        The grey parrot was formally described in 1758 by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of Systema Naturae. He placed it with all other parrots in the genus Psittacus and coined the binomial name Psittacus erithacus. Linnaeus erroneously specified the type locality as "Guinea": the locality was later designated as Ghana in West Africa.[4] The genus name is Latin for "parrot". The specific epithet erithacus is Latin and is derived from the Ancient Greek εριθακος (erithakos) for an unknown bird that was said to mimic human sounds, perhaps the black redstart.</h2>

        <h2>
        The species is monotypic; no subspecies are accepted. The Timneh parrot was formerly treated as a subspecies of the grey parrot, but is now considered a separate species based mainly on results from a genetic and morphological study published in 2007. Although Linnaeus placed all the parrots known to him in the genus Psittacus, only the grey parrot and the Timneh parrot are now assigned to this genus.</h2>
