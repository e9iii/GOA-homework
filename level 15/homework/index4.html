    <h2>The kakapo [ 1 ] ( Māori kākāpō "night parrot"), or owl parrot [ 1 ] ( Latin:  Strigops habroptila ), is a nocturnal flightless bird of the family Strigopidae [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] , endemic to New Zealand [ 5 ] . According to DNA studies, it belongs to the oldest surviving family of the order Psittacidae, basal to the other families [ 4 ] [ 6 ] . The only living flightless parrot and the heaviest species of parrot [ 7 ] .</h2>

    <h2>The plumage is yellow-green with black specks, has a characteristic facial disk with sensitive whisker-like feathers, a huge gray beak, short legs, huge feet and small wings, and a relatively short tail. The kakapo has lost the ability to actively fly [ 7 ] . It leads a nocturnal lifestyle . Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in body size (males are approximately 30-40% larger than females) [ 9 ] [ 10 ] . The rearing of the young occurs without the intervention of the male. The kakapo is the only parrot species that has a polygynous breeding system [ 7 ] .

        The body length is about 60 cm, the weight of mature males is from 2 to 4 kg, females from 1.3 to 2 kg [ 7 ] [ 11 ] . The plumage is soft [ 12 ] ; the underside of the body is greenish-yellow, the upper side is mossy-green, with black stripes on the back. On other parts of the body, the stripes are of different colors: yellow-green, dark brown and lemon-yellow. The facial feathers form a facial disk, like those of owls, and may perform a location function. The voice is hoarse-croaking, turning into shrill unpleasant sounds. One of the unusual characteristics of the kakapo is a strong, but at the same time pleasant smell, similar to the smell of flowers and honey or beeswax .</h2>
        <h2>Anatomy
            The kakapo's skeleton differs from that of other parrots due to its loss of the ability to fly. The kakapo has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, softer, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal grooves joining the feathers together. The thorax is small, has a vestigial keel, and a shortened spina externa (the backbone of birds). Like other flightless birds, the kakapo's wishbone is not fused, but consists of a pair of clavicles that meet at each coracoid . The angle formed by the coracoid processes and the sternum is widened. The pelvis is wider than in other members of the order. The proximal bones of the legs and wings are disproportionately long, and the distal elements are shortened [ 13 ] .
            
            The pectoral musculature of the kakapo is also modified due to the loss of flight. The pectoral and supramarginal muscles are significantly reduced. The kakapo does not have a clearly defined muscle belly. There is a large cucularis capitis clavicularis muscle [ 13 ] .</h2>
